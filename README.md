<center> <h1>RefCM: Reference Cluster-Mapping</h1> </center>


RefCM is an automated tool enabling cell-type annotation across different scRNA-seq datasets. The model bases itself on the geometric properties of optimal transport to map cell-type clusters across tissues, sequencing methods, and species.

## About <a name="about"></a>

The primary purpose of this repository is to enable the reproduction of the results reported in the paper, and help others utilize this method towards their own work.


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

We recommend creation of a new conda environment with the required dependencies using the provided [yaml](./env.yml) file:

```shell
  conda env create -n refcm -f env.yml
  conda activate refcm
```

Windows users may need to follow the steps described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17513666/installing-glpk-gnu-linear-programming-kit-on-windows) and restart their IDE to install GLPK, a requirement for the linear programming solver.

To download the datasets we used, please visit our [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fWWaxBLUdacBT9r-1CymdyRICMPStvBJ?usp=share_link) and our [data setup notebook](./data/setup.ipynb) where we list the original source links and how we processed the data.


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Running RefCM on a given `query: AnnData` and `reference: AnnData` dataset pair, assuming clustering information under their respective `.obs['cluster']` attributes, can be achieved by running the following code and tweaking the remaining hyperparameters. The method expects raw counts to be provided under each dataset's `.X` attribute.

```python
    from refcm import RefCM
    
    rcm = RefCM()
    rcm.setref(reference, 'reference', 'cluster')
    m = rcm.annotate(query, 'query', 'cluster')
```

The resulting annotations are written out to the `.obs['refcm_annot']` field in the query's `AnnData` object, leaving the remaining fields unchanged.

For a graphical representation of the resulting matching/cluster-mapping:

```python
    m.display_matching_costs()
```

Provided a ground-truth `.obs` field, the matching's performance can be evaluated as follows:

```python
    m.display_matching_costs(ground_truth_obs_key='ground_truth_key')
    m.eval(ground_truth_obs_key='ground_truth_key')
```


### Jupyter Notebook Examples <a name="notebook-examples"></a>

Weâ€™ve put together a few example Jupyter notebooks under [/vignettes](./vignettes/) to help you start using RefCM right away. Our starter example, [brain.ipynb](vignettes/brain.ipynb), walks you through applying the method to the Allen Brain Atlas datasets.
